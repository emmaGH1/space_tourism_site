## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation Library
- [Tailwind-Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

```From this project, I was able to dive into framer-motion for the first time and I really enjoyed it. Furthermore, I got better in using tailwind-css, now I don't have to look up the name for every class in their docs.

### Continued development
I want to go into advanced react and learn some best react practices, also I'm going to practice more to make my code more dynamic and dry.
